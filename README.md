# Custom Mapillary Leaderboards

Create your own custom Mapillary leaderboards.

## Ideas

 - Leaderboard Map View(Mapbox GL)
 - Select participants by location (Mapillary API v3 + Mapzen Search?)
 - Leaderboards limited to countries/bounding boxes.
 - Add avatars to Leaderboard(optional?)
 - User pages(like `mapillary.com/profile/<username>` but for bragging :-) )
